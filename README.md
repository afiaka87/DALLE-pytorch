`perugia` is a text-to-image generator. 

Give it a phrase - it tries to recreate an image. 


## Disclaimer
This is a fork of the repository https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch designed to be a bit easier to use.

I've changed the name to reflect my position that this isn't the exact same thing as DALL-E and it is confusing to imply otherwise.

This is _not_ the same DALL-E that OpenAI have presented. It is an attempt at recreating its architecture based on the details released by those researchers. There's not a pretrained model yet, but I believe one is right around the corner.

I have not been able to test this code out on Windows 10 yet. I hope that it works using the conda instructions, but please file an issue if it doesn't.

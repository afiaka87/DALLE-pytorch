This is a fork of the repository https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch designed to be a bit easier to use.

## Disclaimer

This is _not_ the same DALL-E that OpenAI have presented. It is an attempt at recreating its architecture based on the details released by those researchers. There's not a pretrained model yet, but I believe one is right around the corner.

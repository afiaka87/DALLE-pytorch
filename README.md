`perugia` is a text-to-image generator. This project is a developer-oriented fork of @lucidrains incredible DALLE-pytorch project. 

Give it a phrase - it tries to recreate an image. 

If you're looking for a version of this that, you know, actually works presently, you should check out:
- [deep-daze](https://github.com/lucidrains/deep-daze)
- [big-sleep](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep)

For now - there's no pretrained model. You can attempt to train one yourself however -

## Disclaimer
  - This is a fork of the repository https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch designed to be a bit easier to use for regular developers and not researchers.

  - This isn't he same DALL-E that OpenAI have presented. It is an attempt at recreating its architecture based on the details released by those researchers. There's not a pretrained model yet, but I believe one is right around the corner.
  
  - I have not been able to test this code out on Windows 10 yet. I hope that it works using the conda instructions, but please file an issue if it doesn't.
